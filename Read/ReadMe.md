I decide to create a workout ap because exercising has always been part of my life
and now more than ever with easy acces to materials that we can easily sit and binge watch 
for hours , I believe it is crucial to get out there and move a little.
Just like you can pull your phone out and watch you favorite show you can now do the same to find motivation and 
the tools you need to get you moving in no time.
From quick 15 min workoouts to hour long sessions at the gym, no matter your lifestyle you can always find time to "Move"

 
 
 Move was created by Jeanmax Deslouches and developped using React.Js a framework library created by Facebook.
